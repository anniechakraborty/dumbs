## About

This a basic guess a magic number game. It uses the `random` module to generate the magic number everytime the user wants to play. The user gets five turns to guess the number. If the guess is right, the user wins and the game ends. If the guess is incorrect and there are turns remaining then a prompt will be triggered to give a hint to the user.

To play the game, download the zip, extract it and run the `app.py` file
